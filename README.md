# Fantastic Snowboards

This is a practice project I've made to learn about the MERN stack, and to practice my React skills. It is a mock e-commerce site for a snowboard company, where users can browse products. The image carousel will associated the product variant with the displayed variant data.

The deployed site can be found [HERE](https://fantasticfy.onrender.com/)

Due to the usage limitations of Render and Cyclic, where I've hosted the Node.js backends for various projects, the backend code for this project can be found [HERE](https://github.com/misterplain/activeServer)

Any and all feedback on this project is welcome, you may contact me [HERE](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-o-brien-6743b044/)!
