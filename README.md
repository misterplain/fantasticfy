# Fantastic Snowboards

This is a practice project I've made to learn about the MERN stack, and to practice my React skills. It is a mock e-commerce site for a snowboard company, where users can browse products and click through to the product page. The image carousel will associate the product variant with the displayed variant data.

The deployed site can be found [HERE](https://fantasticfy.onrender.com/)

Any and all feedback on this project is welcome, you may contact me [HERE](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-o-brien-6743b044/)!
